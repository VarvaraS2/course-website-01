title: "Welcome to The Human Side of Shipping"
---
Have you ever thought about how your favorite things, like your morning coffee or a new pair of sneakers, actually get to you? 

Behind every delivery is a group of people working tirelessly at sea, spending months away from their families to keep the world moving. 

This project is about them, the invisible hands who face storms, long hours, and tough conditions so that we can enjoy the things we often take for granted. 

As you explore, take a moment to appreciate the lives and stories behind every package that arrives at your door.
